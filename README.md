# authentication
Authentication using NodeJS, ExpressJS, Mysql2, JWT, Typescript, ReactTS


## Server-side packages used  
* helmet - to secure express apps by setting HTTP response headers.
* JWT - for authentication stored server-side with cookie HTTP ONLY. (for security purpose)
* morgan - to log HTTP requests and errors.
* bcrypt - to hash the password.
* cors - to initiate requests to the API from various ports.
* mysql2 - for data persistence within a MySQL relational database. (While I acknowledge that opting for MySQL might not align with the project's logic, considering NOSQL instead, the choice was made for the sake of practice and experimentation.)

## Client-side packages used 
* React - I'm familiar with React and I prefer organizing all elements as components.
* Typescript - Chosen for enhanced security and code completion and also better organization using interface, enums, type.
* Sass - for stylesheet, i like the way it work.
* axios - for API request stuff.
